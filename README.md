## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error stating that Python is not recognized as an internal or external command, this means that Python is not added to your system's PATH. You can either add it to the PATH or specify the full path to the Python executable while running the script, for example: C:\Python39\python.exe youtube_downloader.py

Replace `C:\Python39\` with the actual path where Python is installed on your system.
